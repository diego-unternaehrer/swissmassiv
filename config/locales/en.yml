      unique_lead: "swiss massiv skis are hand-made in the heart of Switzerland.
                    They are the outcome of a long-time passion
                    and quest for precision crafting of a highly complex
                    design product. The result is an unequalled, timeless
                    design of uncompromising quality, incorporating
                    leading, state of the art technology – a ski that
                    performs with a supremely comfortable glide that is
                    both smooth and dynamic."
      unique_text: "Ecology, sustainability and functionality are the guiding
                    elements in the development of swissmassiv skis.
                    Individually sources local wood is incorporated with
                    bamboo, using uni-quely created construction techniques
                    to produce a result that is both technically and
                    visually striking.
                    Because swiss massiv skis are all hand-made, each
                    ski is a one of a kind product. The skis are made to
                    the bodyweight and driving style of the skier. Their
                    unique identity is further expressed in limited production,
                    with each pair having an individual number.
                    swiss massiv skis are for connoisseurs who look for
                    and ap-preciate the extraordinary."
      rigour: "Rigour."
      hightech: "Hightech base."
      hightech_text: "In order to maintain the best possible glide for all types of snow,
                      we use high quality Isospeed Nano Highspeed bases."
      innovative: "Innovative."
      innovative_text: "A tool, developed by swiss massiv, is used to punch small holes into
                        the rubber sheet. The rubber sheet layers help distributing elasticity
                        in an even manner and add to the strength of gluing process, which
                        combines the different materials of each layer together."
      one_of_a_kind: "Every ski is one of a kind."
      one_of_a_kind_text: "The natural wood grain of the top sheet of each ski,
                          gives them all a unique look."
      technology: "Technology."
      technology_text: "The edges use in swiss massiv skis have a 48° Rockwell hardness. We only
                        use serrated edges for stronger anchoring with the body of the ski."
      hand_crafted: "Hand crafted."
      hand_crafted_text: "The process of creating swiss massiv skis is primarily done through
                          manual work, such as the fitting of the edges."
      many-layered: "Many-layered."
      many-layered_text: "The precision cut parts of the skis are layered and individually glued together.
                          This is done through a labor intensive process of covering all layers
                          with two-component epoxy resin inside a form for subsequent pressing."
      quality: "Quality requires time."
      quality_text: "A pair of swiss massiv skis consists of some 30 individual parts.
                    Building them is done in a process of almost 50 work steps which take
                    about nine hours of labor. Together with all the waiting periods
                    for drying, a pair of skis takes about three weeks to produce."
      sandwich: "Sandwich construction."
      sandwich_text: "The wet sandwich construction makes it possible to combine very
                      different materials such as wood, steel, fiberglass, aluminium, rubber into
                      one entity. This construction technique is used to directly influence the
                      key bounce-back and torsion points of the skis."
      heart: "The heart of the ski."
      heart_text: "swiss massiv uses Paulowina as a solid timber at its core, as well as
                  elmwood veneer and fiber bamboo side walls."
      precision: "Precision."
      precision_text: "Based on the body weight of the customer, the core of the skis is
                      sanded down to a different thickness to adjust the stiffness of the
                      skis. Because of this adjustment the edge grip is evenly distributed to
                      the whole length of the ski."
      detail: "Love for detail."
      detail_text: "With a long experience of building skis in Switzerland, we look at each
                    detail in the tradition of Swiss perfection and precision."
      pressing: "Pressing."
      pressing_text: "Once all the layers are assembled, the skis are pressed into form over 90
                      minutes using approximately 28 tons or weight. The newly pressed skis
                      are then let to cool, dry and settle for a few days."
      bamboo: "Bamboo side walls."
      bamboo_text: "Bamboo has long fiber and its hardness is excellent to transmit pressure
                    directly to the ski edges. It also adapts well to cold temperatures. swiss massiv
                    side walls are a trapeze shape giving a tapered edge and therefore thicker
                    on the lower end."
      metal: "Exposed metal upper edge."
      metal_text: "Few skis have an metal upper edge. This important element to protect the
                  wooden upper surface of the ski was done traditionally and phased out
                  with mass production."
      engraving: "Engraving."
      engraving_text: "The wood veneer is cut down to the Titanal aluminium
                      layer with a digitally controlled engraver. The result is a strong,
                      distinctive three-dimensional design."
      edges: "Finishing the edges."
      edges_text: "The edges are sharpened manually to an 88° angle. This contributes
                  significantly to the handling of the skis in the snow."
      base: "Ski base preparation."
      base_text: "Edges and base are pre-ground by hand for the finish. This is done
                  based on years of experience rather than by a computer program.
                  A well ground base and edges determine the skis’ glide and turning."
      limited: "Limited serial numbers."
      limited_text: "Every pair of skis has its unique serial number engraved in stainless steel at the back."
